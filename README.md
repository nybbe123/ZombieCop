# ZOMBIECOP
My own little game i developed on my spare time as an training excersize. The game has been developed mainly by .TS and .p5. The rules are simple, move in x-direction with 'a' and 'd', shoot with 'enter' and eleminate as many zombies as possible. The game is endless, and you have 4 lifes and every time a zombie gets pass you one life will disapear. When all your life is gone then game is over and you have lost.
